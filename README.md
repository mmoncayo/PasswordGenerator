# Password Generator

Deployed Link: https://mmoncayo.github.io/PasswordGenerator/

This homework assignment required me to be able to write out pseudocode to fully visualize exactly what I was trying to execute for the Password Generator

The main components in the JavaScript were: 

* A series of prompts to the user to identify the criteria needed to populate the right password type

* Declaring all the variables for the different character types

* A function that generates random characters based on the character type

* A for loop that executes the random character generation based on the length of the password that the user inputs

* Including validity checks on both a valid character length entry was inputted and at least one character type was selected

Overall this assignment was challenging to the developer to fully understand dynamically how coding is being taken from the HTML and written/processed from what the input the user provides using javascript, and ultimately producing the final password generated back onto the HTML screen.
